Project 2D Submission

Chris worked on load.
Terry and Chris worked on select.

Select works correctly, but doesn't always have great performance.
From our testing, it always returns the right number of tuples.
However, sometimes it reads more pages than it should.
We were unable to trace down this bug in time.
